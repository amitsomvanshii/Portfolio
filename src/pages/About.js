  I am Amit Singh, an MCA student with a strong interest in Data Analytics and
  Business Analysis. I enjoy working on real-world projects involving data
  cleaning, SQL-based analysis, reporting, and visualization.

  I have skills in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and React, and I aim to start
  my career in a data-driven role where I can support decision-making through
  insights, dashboards, and structured problem-solving.

  I also have basic exposure to predictive analytics using Machine Learning.
